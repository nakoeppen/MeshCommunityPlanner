## What It Does

Mesh Community Planner helps you design LoRa mesh networks before buying hardware. Place nodes on a map, simulate RF coverage using real terrain data, pick from a catalog of real devices, and generate a shopping list. Everything runs locally on your computer — no accounts, no cloud, no telemetry.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ with pip
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- PyInstaller 6.x (`pip install pyinstaller`)

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PapaSierra555/MeshCommunityPlanner.git
cd MeshCommunityPlanner

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller

cd frontend && npm install && npx vite build && cd ..

python -m PyInstaller installers/mesh_planner.spec --noconfirm
```

### Run

```bash
# Windows
dist\MeshCommunityPlanner\MeshCommunityPlanner.exe

# macOS / Linux
./dist/MeshCommunityPlanner/MeshCommunityPlanner
```

The app starts a local server and opens your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8321`.
