# Mesh Community Planner

A desktop application for planning LoRa mesh network deployments with terrain-aware RF propagation modeling, hardware catalog integration, and comprehensive bill of materials generation.

## Overview

Mesh Community Planner helps community groups, emergency preparedness teams, and mesh network enthusiasts design complete LoRa mesh deployments before purchasing hardware. The application provides an all-in-one planning experience: place nodes on a map, simulate coverage using terrain-aware propagation models, select from real hardware/firmware combinations, enforce regulatory constraints, and generate a complete shopping list with deployment instructions.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive map interface with coverage visualization and connectivity analysis
- Elevation heatmap with adjustable min/max range sliders for local terrain contrast
- Terrain-aware RF propagation (Longley-Rice/ITWOM)
- Hardware catalog with 11+ LoRa devices (Meshtastic, MeshCore, Reticulum/RNode)
- Regulatory presets for US FCC, EU 868 MHz, EU 433 MHz, and ANZ
- Power budgeting with solar deployment recommendations
- Bill of materials in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, deployment cards)
- Line-of-sight terrain profile visualization
- Network topology and resilience analysis
- Fully offline-capable after initial data caching
- Complete WCAG 2.2 AA + EN 301 549 accessibility compliance
- Privacy-first architecture (all data local, no telemetry)

  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later
  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or equivalent Linux distribution

## Quick Start

1. **Create a new plan:** Click "New Plan" and give your network a name
2. **Place your first node:** Click on the map to place a node, then configure:
   - Region (US, EU 868, EU 433, ANZ)
   - Firmware (Meshtastic, MeshCore, or Reticulum/RNode)
   - Hardware (choose from catalog or define custom)
   - Radio parameters (modem preset or manual configuration)
   - Antenna, cable, and optional PA module
3. **View instant coverage:** Free-space path loss (FSPL) preview appears immediately
4. **Run terrain analysis:** Click "Run Propagation" for full terrain-aware coverage modeling
5. **Analyze connectivity:** View the topology graph to see mesh links and resilience metrics
6. **Generate BOM:** Click "Bill of Materials" to see complete hardware list with pricing
7. **Export deployment package:** Save your plan and export deployment cards for field installation

### Key Guidelines

- **Tests:** New features should include unit tests
- **Accessibility:** UI changes should pass axe-core checks and WCAG 2.2 AA
- **Security:** Use parameterized queries, validate all inputs

## File Formats

### .meshplan
Versioned JSON format containing plan configuration, all nodes, and metadata. Includes SHA-256 integrity checksum. Backwards-compatible from v1.0.

### .meshnode
Single node configuration export in JSON format with checksum.

### .meshtemplate
Node configuration template (excludes coordinates) in JSON format with checksum.

## Architecture

- **Single-process:** Backend serves frontend as static files on a single localhost port
- **Offline-first:** Full operation after initial map/terrain caching
- **Privacy-first:** All data local, no telemetry, explicit consent for external APIs
- **Security:** Localhost-only binding, parameterized queries
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA + EN 301 549 compliance with axe-core validation

See the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for project structure details.

## External Services

The application fetches data from external services as needed:

- **OpenStreetMap:** Map tiles (when viewing the map)
- **USGS Earth Explorer:** SRTM terrain data (on-demand download for propagation analysis)
- **Nominatim:** Address search / geocoding (when using the search bar)

## Privacy & Security

- **No telemetry or analytics** — zero data collection
- **Local-only storage** — all plans and settings stay on your machine
- **Secure by default** — localhost-only binding, parameterized queries

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure process.
