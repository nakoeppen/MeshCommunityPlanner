## Introduction

Mesh Community Planner is a desktop application for planning LoRa mesh network deployments. It runs a local web server and opens in your browser — no accounts, no cloud, no internet required after initial setup. All your data stays on your machine.

### What You Can Do

- Place nodes on an interactive OpenStreetMap
- Configure each node with real hardware from a built-in device catalog
- Simulate RF coverage using terrain-aware propagation (Longley-Rice/ITWOM with SRTM 30m elevation data)
- Analyze line-of-sight between nodes with terrain profiles and Fresnel zone clearance
- View network topology and identify single points of failure
- Run advanced analysis: viewshed, LoRa airtime calculations, channel capacity estimation, message flooding simulation, and optimal node placement suggestions
- Generate a bill of materials with pricing, CSV/PDF export, and printable deployment cards
- Export plans in multiple formats: .meshplan JSON, CSV, KML, GeoJSON, and CoT/TAK XML

### System Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10+, macOS 11+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **RAM:** 4 GB
- **Disk:** 500 MB for the application, plus up to 2 GB for cached map tiles and terrain data
- **Browser:** Chrome 100+, Firefox 98+, Safari 15+, Edge 100+
- **Internet:** Required for map tiles and terrain data on first use. After caching, the app works fully offline.

---

## Getting Started

### Launching the Application

- **Windows:** Start Menu → Mesh Community Planner, or run `MeshCommunityPlanner.exe`
- **macOS:** Applications → Mesh Community Planner
- **Linux:** Run the AppImage or use the desktop shortcut

The app starts a local server on port 8321 and opens your default browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8321`. If the browser doesn't open automatically, navigate to that address manually.

### First Launch

On first launch, 4 sample plans are loaded so you can explore the interface immediately:

- **(Sample) Colorado Terrain** — 4 nodes demonstrating how terrain affects coverage
- **(Sample) EU 868 Urban Mesh - Berlin** — 4 nodes with EU 868 MHz regulatory settings
- **(Sample) SF Bay Area Mixed Mesh** — 6 nodes across varied terrain (hills, water, urban)
- **(Sample) Suburban Neighborhood Mesh** — 3 nodes in a simple residential layout

Click any sample plan to open it and explore the features. These plans are read-only examples — you can duplicate them if you want to experiment with changes.

### Interface Overview

The main interface has four areas:

- **Toolbar** (top) — Menus for Plan, Plan Info, Tools, Catalog, and Help. This is where you access all major actions: creating plans, placing nodes, running analysis, importing/exporting, and managing the hardware catalog.
- **Map** (center) — Interactive OpenStreetMap with node markers, coverage overlays, and link visualizations. Click to place nodes, drag to move them, and use the mouse wheel to zoom.
- **Side Panel** (right) — Contextual panel showing node details, the configuration wizard, or analysis results when active.
- **Status Bar** (bottom) — Shows current map coordinates, zoom level, selected node count, and analysis progress.

### Welcome Tour

On your very first launch, a guided tour walks you through the main features step by step. You can dismiss it at any time by clicking "Skip Tour." To replay the tour later, use the Help menu.

## Managing Plans

A plan is a complete mesh network design — it contains all your nodes, their configurations, and any analysis results.

### Creating a New Plan

1. Open the **Plan** menu in the toolbar
2. Click **New Plan**
3. Enter a plan name (e.g., "Downtown Network")
4. Select firmware: **Meshtastic**, **MeshCore**, or **Reticulum/RNode**
5. Select region: **US FCC**, **EU 868**, **EU 433**, or **ANZ**
6. Click **Create**

The map opens centered on the default location. Navigate to your deployment area by panning and zooming, or use the address search bar to jump to a specific location.

### Opening an Existing Plan

1. Open the **Plan** menu
2. Click **Open Plan**
3. Select a plan from the list of saved plans
4. The map loads with all the plan's nodes and any cached analysis results

### Plan Operations

- **Rename:** Click the plan name in the toolbar to edit it inline
- **Duplicate:** Plan menu → **Duplicate Plan** creates an exact copy with a new name
- **Close:** Plan menu → **Close Plan** unloads the plan from view but keeps it saved
- **Delete:** Plan menu → **Delete Plan** permanently removes the plan and all its nodes (confirmation required)

### Auto-Save

All changes are saved automatically to the local SQLite database as you work. There is no manual save button — every node placement, edit, and deletion is persisted immediately. To create a portable file you can share with others, use the Export feature.

### Plan Info Panel

Open the **Plan Info** menu in the toolbar to see a summary of all loaded plans:

- Total plans and total node count
- Per-plan details: name, node count, firmware, and region
- Network statistics: total nodes, LOS links, coverage overlays, radio configuration, and environment type

---

## Working with Nodes

Nodes are the devices in your mesh network. Each node represents a physical location where you plan to install a LoRa radio.

### Adding a Node

1. Click **Add Node** in the toolbar (or press `Insert`)
2. Your cursor changes to indicate placement mode
3. Click on the map where you want to place the node
4. The **Node Configuration Wizard** opens with the location pre-filled

When you add your first node, you choose the radio settings (firmware, region, frequency, modem preset). Subsequent nodes automatically inherit these network-wide settings to maintain consistency across your mesh.

After completing the wizard, the node appears on the map with an FSPL coverage circle showing its estimated range.

### Selecting Nodes

- **Single select:** Click a node marker on the map. It turns red to indicate selection.
- **Multi-select:** Hold `Ctrl` and click additional nodes. They turn orange. The last-clicked node is the primary selection (red).
- **Cycle through nodes:** Press `Tab` to select the next node, or `Shift+Tab` for the previous one.
- **Focus on a node:** Press `Enter` to center the map on the selected node.

### Editing a Node

1. Click a node marker on the map to select it
2. The node details panel opens on the right
3. Click **Edit** to reopen the Configuration Wizard
4. Make changes to any step and click **Done**

### Moving a Node

Drag the node marker to a new position on the map. The FSPL coverage circle updates automatically. If you have multiple nodes selected, dragging one moves the entire group.

### Deleting a Node

Select the node and click **Delete** in the details panel, or press the `Delete` key. A confirmation dialog appears for destructive actions.

### Bulk Import from CSV

For large deployments, you can import node locations from a spreadsheet:

1. Open the **Plan** menu
2. Click **Import Nodes (CSV)**
3. Select your CSV file
4. Review the column mapping (auto-detected)
5. Click **Import Nodes**

**Required CSV columns:** `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`

**Optional columns:** `antenna_height`, `device`, `frequency`, `tx_power`, `modem_preset`, `role`

Imported nodes inherit the plan's default radio settings for any fields not specified in the CSV.

### Node Templates

Templates let you save a complete node configuration (device, radio, antenna, power) and reuse it for multiple nodes:

1. Configure a node completely through the wizard
2. On the Save as Template step, check "Save this configuration as a template"
3. Give the template a name (e.g., "Standard Relay")
4. When adding new nodes, select the template to pre-fill all settings
5. Only change the name, location, and antenna height per site

Templates save significant time when deploying multiple nodes with identical hardware.

---

## The Node Configuration Wizard

The wizard guides you through configuring a node in 7 steps. A progress bar at the top shows your completion status, and breadcrumb navigation lets you jump back to any completed step.

### Step 1: Location

- **Latitude** — Pre-filled from your map click. Editable with 0.000001° precision.
- **Longitude** — Pre-filled from your map click. Editable with 0.000001° precision.
- **Node Name** — A descriptive name for this site (e.g., "Tower Hill", "Community Center Roof").

### Step 2: Device Configuration

- **Device ID** — Select a device from the hardware catalog or enter a custom device name.
- **Firmware Family** — The mesh firmware this device will run: Meshtastic, MeshCore, or Custom.

The catalog pre-fills device specs (frequency range, max TX power, receiver sensitivity, GPS, battery type) based on your selection.

### Step 3: Radio Configuration

- **TX Power (dBm)** — Transmit power output. Default: 20 dBm. Higher values increase range but consume more battery. Typical range: 14–20 dBm.
- **RX Sensitivity (dBm)** — How weak a signal the receiver can detect. Default: -120 dBm. Lower (more negative) values mean better weak-signal reception. Typical: -120 to -130 dBm.
- **Region Code** — Regulatory region that determines allowed frequency bands and maximum transmit power: US (FCC), EU (ETSI), ANZ, etc.

### Step 4: Antenna Configuration

- **Antenna Gain (dBi)** — How much the antenna focuses the signal. Default: 2 dBi. Omnidirectional antennas: 0–3 dBi. Directional antennas: 3–15+ dBi.
- **Antenna Height (m)** — Height above ground level. This is one of the most impactful settings for coverage. Even small increases (2m → 10m) can dramatically improve range by clearing terrain obstacles.
- **Cable Loss (dB)** — Signal lost in the coaxial cable between radio and antenna. Default: 0 dB. Typical: 0–3 dB for short runs. Use low-loss cable for long runs.
- **Environment** — The terrain around this node. Affects propagation calculations:
  - **LOS Elevated** — Clear line-of-sight from an elevated position (tower, hilltop)
  - **Open Rural** — Flat open terrain with minimal obstacles
  - **Suburban** — Residential area with houses and trees
  - **Urban** — Dense buildings and structures
  - **Indoor** — Inside a building

### Step 5: Advanced Options

- **Status** — The deployment stage of this node:
  - **Configured** — Planned but not yet installed
  - **Deployed** — Installed and operational
  - **Inactive** — Temporarily offline or decommissioned

### Step 6: Save as Template

- **Save this configuration as a template** — Check this box to save the current settings as a reusable template. You'll be prompted for a template name.
- Template saves everything except the location coordinates, so you can reuse the same hardware configuration at different sites.

### Step 7: Review

A read-only summary of all settings organized by section:

- **Location:** Latitude, Longitude, Name
- **Device:** Device ID, Firmware
- **Radio:** TX Power, RX Sensitivity, Region
- **Antenna:** Gain, Height, Cable Loss, Environment

Review the configuration and click **Finish** to save the node, or use the breadcrumb navigation to go back and change any step.

## Using the Map

### Navigation

- **Pan:** Click and drag the map, or use arrow keys
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel, or `+` / `-` keys
- **Reset zoom:** `Ctrl+0`
- **Center on all nodes:** `Home` key

### Address Search

The search bar at the top of the map lets you find and navigate to any location:

1. Type an address, city name, or landmark
2. Autocomplete results appear as you type
3. Click a result (or use arrow keys and Enter) to center the map on that location
4. Click the clear button to reset the search

The search uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap's geocoding service) — no API key required.

### Layer Controls

Toggle map overlays on and off to control what's visible:

- **Coverage Circles** — FSPL range circles around each node
- **Connectivity Lines** — LOS links between connected nodes
- **Heatmap** — Signal strength heat map from terrain propagation
- **Overlap Zones** — Areas where multiple nodes provide coverage
- **Planning Radius** — Desired coverage radius indicators
- **Node Labels** — Node names displayed on the map
- **Fresnel Zones** — First Fresnel zone visualization on links

### Coverage Legend

When terrain coverage overlays are active, a legend appears showing the signal strength color scale:

| Color | Signal Strength | Quality |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Red | > -80 dBm | Strong |
| Orange | -80 to -90 dBm | Good |
| Yellow | -90 to -100 dBm | Fair |
| Green | -100 to -110 dBm | Weak |
| Cyan | -110 to -120 dBm | Marginal |
| Blue | -120 to -130 dBm | At receiver limit |

An opacity slider lets you adjust the transparency of the coverage overlay so you can see the underlying map.

### Clearing Overlays

To remove all analysis overlays (LOS links, coverage heatmaps, viewshed, route paths) from the map, use Tools menu → **Clear Overlays**.

---

## Propagation Analysis

Propagation analysis predicts how far your radio signals will travel, accounting for terrain, frequency, power, and antenna configuration.

### FSPL Preview (Instant)

When you place a node, a green circle immediately appears showing the estimated free-space path loss (FSPL) range. This calculation assumes flat terrain with no obstacles — it gives you a quick "best case" estimate.

FSPL circles are useful for initial planning but will overestimate coverage in hilly or obstructed terrain. For accurate predictions, run terrain-aware propagation.

### Terrain-Aware Coverage (Signal-Server)

For realistic coverage predictions that account for hills, valleys, and terrain features:

1. Open the **Tools** menu
2. Click **Coverage Analysis**
3. The analysis runs on all nodes, or only selected nodes if you have a selection

**What happens behind the scenes:**

1. The app checks if SRTM 30m elevation data is cached for your area
2. If not, it downloads the required terrain tiles from USGS (this happens automatically)
3. The Longley-Rice/ITWOM propagation model runs a radial sweep from each node (360 bearings by default)
4. At each bearing, the terrain profile is sampled and knife-edge diffraction is applied where terrain obstructs the path
5. Results are rendered as a colored heat map overlay on the map

**First-run timing:**
- Terrain download for a small area (~10 km): ~30 seconds
- Terrain download for a large area (~100 km): 2–5 minutes
- After caching, subsequent runs in the same area are much faster

**Reading the results:**

The coverage overlay replaces the simple FSPL circles with a terrain-aware heat map. Notice that coverage is no longer circular — it follows the terrain. Signals travel farther over flat ground and are blocked by hills and ridges.

**Adjusting coverage:**

If coverage is insufficient for your deployment:

- **Increase antenna height** — The single most effective change. Going from 2m to 10m can dramatically improve range.
- **Increase transmit power** — Within your region's regulatory limits (check the regulatory presets).
- **Use a higher-gain antenna** — A directional antenna focuses energy in one direction for longer point-to-point links.
- **Add relay nodes** — Place additional nodes on high ground to bridge coverage gaps.
- **Use the placement suggestion tool** — Let the app recommend optimal locations (see [Analysis Tools](#analysis-tools)).

---

## Line-of-Sight Analysis

Line-of-sight (LOS) analysis checks whether two nodes have a clear radio path by examining the terrain between them.

### Running LOS Analysis

1. Open the **Tools** menu
2. Click **Line of Sight**
3. The analysis runs between all node pairs, or only between selected nodes (select 2+ nodes for a subset)

### Understanding Results

LOS links appear as colored lines on the map between node pairs. Each link includes:

- **Distance** — Straight-line distance between the two nodes
- **Signal Strength** — Predicted received signal in dBm
- **Link Margin** — How much signal headroom above the receiver sensitivity (higher is better)
- **Link Quality** — Classified as Strong, Marginal, NLOS (non-line-of-sight), or Not Viable
- **Fresnel Clearance** — Percentage of the first Fresnel zone that is clear of terrain
- **Max Obstruction** — Height of terrain above the direct radio path (0 if clear)
- **Path Loss** — Total signal loss including free-space and terrain effects

### Terrain Profile View

When you select a link, a terrain elevation profile shows:

- **Ground elevation** between the two points (brown fill)
- **Direct radio path** (straight line between antennas)
- **First Fresnel zone boundary** (the elliptical zone around the direct path where signal integrity matters)
- **Obstruction points** where terrain enters the Fresnel zone

A clear Fresnel zone (60%+ clearance) indicates a good radio path. Obstructions in the Fresnel zone cause signal degradation even if the direct line-of-sight is clear.

### Link Report

For a comprehensive view of all links, use Tools menu → **Link Report**. This opens a sortable table showing every node pair with all link metrics. Links are sorted with the weakest connections first, so you can quickly identify problem areas.

---

## Network Topology

The topology view shows the logical structure of your mesh network — which nodes can communicate and how the network connects.

### Viewing the Topology

After running LOS analysis, the topology information is available in the Plan Info panel. The network statistics show:

- **Total Nodes** — Count of all devices in the plan
- **LOS Links** — Number of viable radio links between node pairs
- **Connected Components** — Number of separate network segments. Ideally this is 1 (all nodes in one connected network). If it's more than 1, some nodes are isolated.
- **Coverage Overlays** — Number of active coverage calculations

### Resilience Metrics

A resilient mesh network has multiple paths between important nodes. Key metrics:

- **Articulation Points** — Nodes whose removal would split the network into separate parts. These are single points of failure and should be addressed by adding redundant paths.
- **Network Diameter** — The maximum number of hops between any two nodes. Lower is better for latency.

### Improving Resilience

If the analysis identifies articulation points:

1. Look at where the network has only one path between groups of nodes
2. Add relay nodes to create alternative paths
3. Re-run LOS analysis to verify the new links
4. The articulation point should disappear once redundant paths exist

A well-designed mesh network should have at least 2 independent paths between critical nodes.

---

## Analysis Tools

Beyond basic propagation and LOS, the Tools menu provides several advanced analysis capabilities.

### Viewshed Analysis

Viewshed shows which areas and nodes are visible from a selected observer node, based on terrain:

1. Select a single node on the map
2. Open Tools menu → **Viewshed Analysis**
3. The result shows:
   - Visible nodes (green indicators) — clear line of sight
   - Blocked nodes (red indicators) — terrain obstructs the view
   - Distance to each node
   - Maximum terrain obstruction height

This is useful for siting relay nodes on hilltops or towers — you can see exactly which parts of your network a given location can reach.

### LoRa Airtime Calculator

Calculate how long a LoRa packet takes to transmit on air:

1. Open Tools menu → **LoRa Airtime Calculator**
2. Select a modem preset (or configure manually):
   - Spreading Factor (SF5–SF12)
   - Bandwidth (125, 250, or 500 kHz)
   - Coding Rate (4/5, 4/6, 4/7, or 4/8)
3. Set payload size in bytes
4. Configure preamble length, header mode, and CRC
5. The calculator shows:
   - **Airtime** — Duration of the transmission in milliseconds
   - **Data Rate** — Effective throughput in bits per second
   - **Duty Cycle** — How this airtime relates to regulatory duty cycle limits

A comparison table at the bottom shows airtime for the same payload across all modem presets, so you can quickly see the trade-offs between range and speed.

### Channel Capacity Estimator

Estimate how much traffic your mesh network can handle before congestion becomes a problem:

1. Open Tools menu → **Channel Capacity Estimator**
2. Enter:
   - Number of nodes in the network
   - Messages per minute per node
   - Payload size in bytes
   - Modem preset (spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate)
   - Duty cycle limit (100% for US ISM, 10% for EU 868, 1% for EU sub-band, or custom)
3. Results show:
   - **Channel Utilization** — Percentage of available airtime in use. Color-coded: green (<30%), yellow (30–70%), red (>70%).
   - **Collision Probability** — Likelihood of packet collisions using the Pure ALOHA model
   - **Optimal Modem Preset** — Recommendation for the best preset given your traffic pattern

### Message Flooding Simulation

Simulate how a message propagates through your mesh network hop by hop:

1. Open Tools menu → **Message Flooding Sim**
2. Select the source node
3. Configure payload size and inter-node delay
4. Run the simulation

The result shows an animated visualization:
- Wave-by-wave expansion showing how the message spreads through the network
- Hop count badges on each reached node
- Time-on-air for each hop
- Unreached nodes highlighted (network gaps)
- Critical bridge nodes identified
- Network health scoring (connectivity and resilience)

You can also simulate node failure — remove a node and see how it affects message delivery across the network.

### Node Placement Suggestions

Let the app recommend optimal locations for additional nodes to maximize coverage:

1. Open Tools menu → **Suggest Node Placement**
2. Configure the search:
   - Search radius (meters) — How far from existing nodes to search
   - Grid resolution (meters) — Spacing between candidate positions
   - Max candidates — Number of suggestions to return
3. Run the analysis

Results appear as ghost markers on the map, color-coded by score:
- **Green** (score > 0.7) — Excellent placement
- **Yellow** (score 0.4–0.7) — Good placement
- **Red** (score < 0.4) — Marginal improvement

Each suggestion includes the coverage gain in km² and a brief explanation of why that location was recommended. Click **Accept** on any suggestion to add it as a new node.

### Route Finding

Find the shortest multi-hop path between two nodes:

1. Select exactly 2 nodes on the map
2. Open Tools menu → **Find Route**
3. The result shows the optimal path and alternatives:
   - Primary route (fewest hops)
   - Alternative routes if available
   - Per-link quality along each route
   - Total distance and hop count

### Save Screenshot

Capture the current map view as a PNG image: Tools menu → **Save Screenshot**. Useful for reports and presentations.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Planning Your Network

- **Start with the gateway.** Place your internet-connected gateway node first, typically at the highest available point with reliable power.
- **Work outward.** Add relay nodes to extend coverage from the gateway toward your target area.
- **Elevation matters most.** A node at 10m height on a hill will outperform a node at 2m height in a valley, even with higher TX power.
- **Run LOS analysis early.** Before adding many nodes, check that your first few nodes can actually see each other through the terrain.
- **Use the placement suggestion tool.** After placing your initial nodes, let the app recommend where to add relays for maximum coverage gain.

### Hardware Selection

- **Match firmware across your network.** All nodes in a mesh must run the same firmware (Meshtastic, MeshCore, or Reticulum) to communicate.
- **Don't over-spec.** A simple Heltec V3 with a stock antenna works well for many deployments. Save high-gain antennas and PA modules for long links.
- **Account for cable loss.** If you're running a long coaxial cable to a rooftop antenna, the cable loss may negate the antenna gain. Use low-loss cable.

### Propagation Analysis

- **FSPL circles are optimistic.** They assume flat terrain. Always run terrain-aware propagation before making hardware decisions.
- **Check Fresnel clearance.** Even with visual line-of-sight, obstructions in the Fresnel zone degrade signal quality. 60%+ clearance is good.
- **Terrain data caches.** Once you've viewed an area, the SRTM tiles are stored locally. Plan your coverage area while online, then work offline.

### Offline Use

After viewing an area on the map (tiles cache) and running propagation once (terrain data caches), the entire app works offline. If you're planning a field trip:

1. While online, navigate the map to your entire deployment area at the zoom levels you'll use
2. Run at least one propagation analysis to download the terrain data
3. The app will now function completely offline for that area

### Collaboration

While the app stores data locally, you can share plans with others:

1. Export your plan as a `.meshplan.json` file
2. Share the file via email, USB drive, or file sharing
3. The recipient imports the file into their instance
4. Each person works independently with their own copy
