## A

### Antenna
**Definition:** A device that transmits and receives radio signals. In mesh networks, the antenna converts electrical signals into radio waves and vice versa.

**Types:**
- **Omnidirectional:** Radiates signal equally in all directions (360°)
- **Directional:** Focuses signal in one direction for longer range

**Related:** Antenna Height, Gain

---

### Antenna Height
**Definition:** The vertical distance from the ground to the antenna, measured in meters or feet. Higher antennas typically achieve better line-of-sight and longer range.

**Typical Values:**
- Ground level: 0-3m (portable devices)
- Rooftop: 6-15m (residential installations)
- Tower: 20-100m (high-altitude installations)

**Related:** Elevation, Line-of-Sight

---

### API (Application Programming Interface)
**Definition:** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software systems to communicate. In Mesh Community Planner, the backend provides a REST API that the frontend uses to manage plans, nodes, and analysis.

---

### Articulation Point
**Definition:** A node in a mesh network whose removal would disconnect the network into separate parts. Also called a "single point of failure."

**Example:** If removing one relay node causes 5 other nodes to lose connection to the gateway, that relay is an articulation point.

**Why It Matters:** Networks should minimize articulation points for resilience.

**Related:** Topology, Resilience

---

## B

### BOM (Bill of Materials)
**Definition:** A comprehensive list of all hardware and equipment needed to build the planned mesh network, including quantities and estimated costs.

**Includes:**
- Node devices (gateways, relays, clients)
- Antennas and cables
- Power supplies (solar panels, batteries)
- Mounting hardware
- Installation materials

**Related:** Cost Estimate, Hardware

---

### Broadband
**Definition:** High-speed internet access, typically ≥25 Mbps download. Mesh networks can provide internet access when connected to a broadband gateway.

**Note:** LoRa mesh networks are **not** broadband—they provide low-bandwidth data for sensors and messages, not internet streaming.

---

## C

### Cache
**Definition:** Temporary storage of data to speed up future access. Mesh Community Planner caches map tiles and terrain data to work offline.

**Benefits:**
- Faster loading (no re-download)
- Offline functionality

**Related:** Offline Mode, Storage

---

### Client Node
**Definition:** An endpoint device in a mesh network that sends and receives data but doesn't relay traffic for other nodes.

**Examples:** Sensors, handhelds, IoT devices

**Related:** Gateway, Relay, Node

---

---

### Coverage
**Definition:** The geographic area where a mesh network provides signal. Typically measured as a percentage of the target area with adequate signal strength.

**Types:**
- **Predicted coverage:** Calculated via propagation models
- **Actual coverage:** Measured via real-world testing

**Related:** Propagation, Signal Strength

---

## D

### dBm (Decibels Milliwatt)
**Definition:** A unit of measurement for radio signal power, expressed in decibels relative to 1 milliwatt.

**Common Values:**
- 0 dBm = 1 mW (very low power)
- 14 dBm = 25 mW (typical LoRa)
- 20 dBm = 100 mW (common outdoor)
- 27 dBm = 500 mW (high power)
- 30 dBm = 1 W (legal limit in many regions)

**Key Concept:** Every 3 dBm doubles the power (e.g., 14 dBm → 17 dBm = 2x power).

**Related:** TX Power, Signal Strength

---

### Duty Cycle
**Definition:** The percentage of time a radio can transmit, imposed by regulations to prevent spectrum congestion.

**Example:** 1% duty cycle = can transmit for 36 seconds per hour maximum.

**Typical:** LoRa in unlicensed bands often has 1-10% duty cycle limits.

---

## E

- **868 MHz:** Europe (863-870 MHz)
- **433 MHz:** Asia/Africa

**Key Concept:** Lower frequencies (e.g., 433 MHz) travel farther but require larger antennas. Higher frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz) have higher bandwidth but shorter range.

**Related:** LoRa, Spectrum

---

### Fresnel Zone
**Definition:** An elliptical area around the direct line between two antennas where radio waves can interfere with each other. Obstructions in the Fresnel zone can degrade signal.

**Clearance Guidelines:**

- 60-99% clear: Good signal (minor obstructions OK)
- 40-59% clear: Marginal signal (noticeable degradation)
- <40% clear: Poor signal (may not work reliably)

**Why It Matters:** Even if you have line-of-sight, trees or buildings in the Fresnel zone can weaken the signal due to diffraction.

**Related:** Line-of-Sight, Propagation, Diffraction

---

### FSPL (Free Space Path Loss)
**Definition:** A radio propagation model that calculates signal loss in ideal conditions (no terrain, obstacles, or interference). Assumes clear line-of-sight in a vacuum.

**Formula:** FSPL (dB) = 20 log₁₀(distance) + 20 log₁₀(frequency) + 32.45

**Pros:** Fast, simple, no API required

**Cons:** Overly optimistic—doesn't account for real-world terrain or obstacles

**Compare:** ITM/Longley-Rice (terrain-aware)

**Related:** Propagation, Signal Loss

---

## G

### Gateway
**Definition:** The central node in a mesh network that connects to the internet or backhaul network. All data from client and relay nodes eventually routes to a gateway.

**Key Role:** Gateways are critical—if the gateway fails, the entire network loses internet connectivity (but local mesh communication may continue).

**Typical Setup:**
- High antenna (15-30m)
- High TX power (27-30 dBm)
- Reliable power (grid or large solar)
- Backhaul connection (fiber, cellular, satellite)

**Related:** Relay, Client, Backhaul

**Key Concept:** You can have optical LOS but still poor signal if the Fresnel zone is obstructed.

**Related:** Fresnel Zone, Terrain Profile

- -60 dBm: Good (typical indoor)
- -80 dBm: Fair (typical outdoor)
- -100 dBm: Weak (edge of coverage)
- -120 dBm: Minimum detectable signal

**Key Concept:** RSSI is negative. -50 dBm is stronger than -90 dBm.

- 0-5 dB: Marginal
- <0 dB: Unusable (noise stronger than signal)

**Key Concept:** SNR is more important than RSSI alone. A weak signal with low noise (high SNR) is better than a strong signal with high noise (low SNR).

**Related:** RSSI, Noise
