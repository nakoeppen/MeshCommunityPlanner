"""Terrain-aware coverage grid computation using radial sweep.

Computes signal strength at grid points radiating outward from a transmitter,
using SRTM elevation data and knife-edge diffraction for terrain obstructions.
Produces a SPLAT!-style coverage heat map dataset.

Algorithm (per radial azimuth):
  1. Walk outward from TX at sample_interval_m steps, recording terrain elevation
  2. At each sample point, draw the LOS line from TX antenna tip → RX point
     (sample ground elevation + 1.5m handheld height)
  3. Check all previously-recorded terrain along this radial against that LOS line
  4. Find the single worst obstruction above LOS (dominant knife-edge)
  5. Compute Fresnel zone radius at the obstruction point and diffraction loss
  6. Signal = TX EIRP − FSPL(d) − diffraction_loss − environment_excess
  7. Stop radial when signal drops below −135 dBm

Optimization: instead of O(n²) re-scan of all intermediate points, track the
terrain point with the steepest angle from TX.  For each new sample this
single dominant obstacle is re-evaluated against the specific TX→sample LOS
line, giving correct per-point diffraction with O(n) complexity per radial.
