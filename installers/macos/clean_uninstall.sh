# Mesh Community Planner — macOS Clean Uninstall
# =============================================================================
#
# Removes ALL traces of Mesh Community Planner from this Mac:
#   - Application bundles from /Applications
#   - Mounted DMG volumes
#   - Application logs
#   - Local data directory
#   - Cloned source repo (if in ~/MeshCommunityPlanner)
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x clean_uninstall.sh
#   ./clean_uninstall.sh
#
# Safe to run multiple times. Will not error if files are already gone.
#
# If you forked this repo and are building locally, run this before
# each fresh build/test cycle to ensure no stale artifacts remain.
